# Bamazon
In this project, I created a program that works on the command line where the user is asked which product they would like to buy from the list of products. Examples of how the product works are below.

## Why Build this project?
This app is a cool way to help users explore how the command line/terminal work while being able to return specific data based on what someone inputs. It is a fun project to play around with and see what it is capable of.

## How to get started!
To use this app, you need to have git bash. The logo should look something like this ![bash](images/bash.png). Once you have made your way to the terminal and clone the app to your computer, you can get started. There are 4 basic commands you can do. Movie-this, concert-this, Spotify-this-song and do-what-it-says. I will show you examples of how wach of these work.
